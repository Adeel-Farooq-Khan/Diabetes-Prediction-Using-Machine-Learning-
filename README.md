Diabetes Prediction Project

I'm excited to share my latest project on diabetes prediction using machine learning and logistic regression! I trained the model on a dataset of patient data. The model achieved an accuracy of 78.66% on the training data and 77.27% on the test data.

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to help predict and prevent diabetes. By identifying patients at high risk of developing diabetes, we can intervene early and help them manage their condition.

I'm particularly interested in how this technology could be used to improve healthcare outcomes in underserved communities. For example, machine learning could be used to develop screening programs that are more accessible and affordable for people at risk of diabetes.

I'm also interested in exploring other ways that machine learning can be used to improve diabetes care. For example, machine learning could be used to develop personalized treatment plans for patients with diabetes, or to predict the risk of complications such as heart disease and stroke.

I'm excited to continue working on this project and to collaborate with others to make a positive impact on the lives of people with diabetes.
